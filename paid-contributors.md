# Paid Contributors Program

## Overview

In an effort to ensure the continuous development of Parse Platform, contributors can receive a financial compensation for their contribution. The participation under the program is always clearly defined in at least scope and budget before the approval of participation.

## Process

1. The Project Management Committee (PMC) identifies the need for a specific contribution under the program.
2. The PMC either selects a specific person or publishes an open invitation to apply to participate in the program.
3. The PMC optionally holds a call with the selected individual to elaborate the scope and requirements and answer any questions. This is always conducted for first-time participants, and may be skipped for repeated participants if the scope does not require it and there are no questions from the contributor's side.
4. The PMC is available through-out the contribution to guide the participant.
5. The PMC may review agreed milestones in the course of the contribution.
6. The PMC reviews the contribution, expense claim and contribution records submitted by the participant.
7. The participant submits an [expense claim](https://opencollective.com/parse-server/expenses/new) with contribution records to the [Parse Platform Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/parse-server).
8. The PMC approves the expense claim and request the payout from the Open Collective fiscal host.
9. The fiscal host approves the expense claim and initiates the payout.

## Conditions

To ensure financial controlling, the following conditions apply:
- The program participation has been confirmed by the Project Management Committee in writing, prior to starting any compensated contribution.
- The participant must join the Parse Slack channel to be reachable for private communication during their participation.
- The participant submits an expense claim after the contribution materialized.
- The participant submits contribution records in a provided form together with the expense claim.
- In case of deliberately filing false expense claims or contribution records, the participant is excluded from the program without compensation and excluded from future participation.
- The program participation can be confirmed for a maximum period of 3 months after which the participation terminates without action required. Any renewal has to go through the same process of evaluation and confirmation as a first-time participation, and in addition will consider past contribution records.
- In case of insufficient quality or quantity of contribution, the PMC reserves the right to reduce the amount of compensation. In case of reduction, a proper explanation will be given to the contributor.
- In rare cases, the Project Management Committee may redact information about a member's program participation or contribution details if it deemed necessary by the PMC. For example, if the contribution is related to a security vulnerability.
- The Project Management Committee approves or rejects expense claims filed under the program. To avoid any conflict of interest, members of the Project Management Committee can only participate in the program if extraordinary circumstances arise. For example, if no contributors can be found within or outside of the community to make the required contribution in an acceptable form, in urgent and unforeseen situations when timely action is required, or in situations where the task requires confidentiality to prevent detrimental effects for the organization. The primary objective of the program is to engage the broader community, facilitate continuous contribution and leverage community resources. Therefore, rather than participating in the program, it is the Project Management Committee's primary focus to ensure these community resources are formed, maintained and expanded.

These conditions apply to all forms of contributions under the program.
