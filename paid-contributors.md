# Paid Contributors Program

## Overview

In an effort to ensure the continuous technical and organizational development of Parse Platform, contributors can receive financial compensation for their contribution. The participation under the program is clearly defined in scope, budget and time before the approval of participation.

## Process

1. The Project Management Committee (PMC) identifies the need for a specific contribution under the program.
2. The PMC either selects a specific person or publishes an open invitation to apply to participate in the program.
3. The PMC optionally holds a call with the selected individual to elaborate on scope and conditions, and answer any questions. This is always conducted for first-time participants, and may be skipped for repeated participants.
4. The PMC is available through-out the contribution to guide the participant.
5. The PMC may review agreed milestones in the course of the contribution.
6. The PMC reviews the contribution, expense claim and contribution records submitted by the participant.
7. The participant [submits an expense claim](https://opencollective.com/parse-server/expenses/new) with contribution records to the [Parse Platform Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/parse-server).
8. The PMC evaluates and approves the expense claim in a majority decision and requests the payout from the Open Collective fiscal host. In case of rejection, the PMC seeks to resolve any dispute with the participant.
9. The fiscal host approves the expense claim and initiates the payout.

## Conditions

We appreciate the trust financial donors put into the PMC to responsibly manage their funds for the further development of the project. Therefore we apply the following conditions:

- The program participation must be confirmed by the PMC in writing prior to the beginning of the contribution.
- The participant must join the Parse Slack channel to be reachable for private communication during their participation.
- The participant submits an expense claim only after the full contribution materializes.
- The participant submits contribution records in a provided form, together with the expense claim.
- In case of deliberately or negligently filing false expense claims or contribution records, the participant will be removed from the program and excluded from future participation.
- The program participation can be confirmed for a maximum period of 3 months after which the participation terminates without action required. Any renewal has to go through the same process of evaluation and confirmation as a first-time participation, and in addition will consider past contributions.
- In case of failing to meet the agreed contribution scope in quality, quantity or time, the PMC reserves the right to reduce the previously agreed amount of compensation. In case of reduction, a proper explanation based on specific evidence will be given to the contributor.
- In rare cases, the PMC may redact or delay the publication of information about a member's program participation or contribution details if it deems it necessary to do so. For example, if the contribution is related to a security vulnerability.
- The PMC approves or rejects expense claims filed under the program. To avoid any conflict of interest, members of the PMC can only participate in the program if extraordinary circumstances arise. For example, if no contributors can be found within or outside of the community to make the required contribution in an acceptable form, in urgent and unforeseen situations when timely action is required, or in situations where the task requires confidentiality to prevent otherwise detrimental consequences for the organization. If no contributors can be found, it is the PMC's focus to ensure that the critically required community resources are recruited as soon as possible to be able to delegate future contributions to resources outside the PMC. The PMC's primary focus is to facilitate the PCP by ensuring the required community resources are formed, maintained and expanded.
