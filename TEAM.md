# Permissions

Contributors have elevated permission levels granted, based on their role and assigned repository. As a security policy, permissions are granted by assigning a contributor to the appropriate GitHub Team and never as individual permissions. Permissions are reviewed every 6 months and adapted appropriately on a per-repository basis based on the contributor's activity of the past 6 months. This is to only grant permissions as needed in practice. The adaptation is conducted without any action required by the team member and without previous notice.

# Removal

Contributors are removed from Parse Platform after they have not been active for 1 year. The removal is conducted without any action required by the team member and without previous notice.
