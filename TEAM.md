# Contributors

Contributors are selected by the Project Management Committee based on their engagement and contribution in the community. The current list of contributors can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/parse-community/people).

## Permissions

Contributors have elevated permission levels granted, based on their role and assigned repository. As a security policy, permissions are granted by assigning a contributor to the appropriate GitHub Team and never as individual permissions. Permissions are reviewed every 6 months and adapted appropriately on a per-repository basis based on the contributor's activity of the past 6 months. This is to only grant permissions as needed in practice. The adaptation is conducted without any action required by the team member and without previous notice.

## Removal

A contributor is removed as a team member after they have not been active for 1 year. The removal is conducted without any action required by the team member and without previous notice.
